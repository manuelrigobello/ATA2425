    "## Scope of the project\n",
    "Starting from a pre-trained model, the goal of the project is to attach a trained [ner](https://spacy.io/api/entityrecognizer) component to the model such that it will recognize labels coming from the medical field. The code is based on the spaCy Python library ([documentation here](https://spacy.io/api/doc)).\n",
    "\n",
    "To address the [\"catastrophic forgetting\" problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catastrophic_interference), the trained ner component will be attached to a pre-trained model, the same one used for training the component, so that the output of the model will contain labels that can be assigned either by the original ner or by the trained ner component. Another possible solution could be performing a [\"rehease\"](https://spacy.io/api/language#rehearse), but in this project it is not explored."
