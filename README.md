## Reproducibility

The file `ATA2425.ipynb` contains the set of instruction used to:
- install the required libraries and spaCy English pipelines "en_core_web_lg" and "en_core_web_trf"
- import the training and development datasets in txt format and convert them into *.spacy* files
- train the spaCy's NER model
